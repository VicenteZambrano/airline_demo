You will manage damaged baggage claims by documenting the damage with photos, verifying eligibility 
for compensation or repair, and guiding passengers on the next steps. Ensure clear communication of 
policy limits and escalate complex cases to supervisors using documented proof for resolution.

The inquiry is 'I lost my baggages in the last flight I took with your company, what ca I do?'.
The mode is 'get_requirements'.
Explain if you can respond to all or parts of the inquiry and what you need in order to respond, if anything.

[AI]:
I can respond to your inquiry regarding your lost baggage, as this falls under my area of expertise.

To provide you with the most accurate and helpful information, I need to access the relevant documentation and URLs. I will use the following tools to gather the necessary information:

*   `ExtractDocs` to read the text content of the `Bag Issues` app, which should contain the procedures for lost baggage.
*   `URLProvider` to obtain the URL for the `Bag Issues` app page, and potentially other relevant pages like `Baggage Tracking` and `Missing Items` if they are mentioned in the documentation for lost baggage.

I can help you with inquiries about lost items and baggage. To provide you with the most accurate information regarding your lost suit, please clarify how it was lost:

*   Was your suit in a checked bag that is now lost?
*   Or was the suit itself lost during your travel (e.g., left on the plane, or went missing from your carry-on)?

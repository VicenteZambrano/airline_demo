[AI]:
Hello! I can definitely help you find flights.

To give you the most accurate information, could you please tell me:

1.  **Where would you like to fly from?** (Your departure city)
2.  **Where would you like to fly to?** (Your arrival city)
3.  **What are your preferred travel dates?** (e.g., "next Tuesday," "July 15th," "anytime in August")

Once I have these details, I can look up available flights for you.

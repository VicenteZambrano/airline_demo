I can respond to the inquiry about changing your booking after purchase, as this falls under my responsibility for managing ticket modifications.\n\nTo provide a general answer regarding the possibility of changing a booking, I do not require any specific information.\n\nHowever, if you wish to inquire about the specific rules for your particular booking, or to proceed with a modification, I would need the following information:\n*   Your booking reference or ticket number\n*   The passenger's name

[AI]:
Yes, I can help you with inquiries about changing your booking after purchase, as this falls under my responsibilities as the ticketing assistant.

Generally, changes to bookings after purchase are often possible, but they are subject to the specific fare rules of your ticket. These rules can vary depending on the type of ticket you purchased. There might be change fees, or you might need to pay the difference in fare if the new flight is more expensive.

If you would like to know the specific rules for your particular booking, or if you wish to proceed with a modification, please provide me with:
*   Your booking reference or ticket number
*   The passenger's name
